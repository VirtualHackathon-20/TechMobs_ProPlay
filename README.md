# Android
A mobile based application on the users end and a web application on the publishers end. The user can download and install the app. The app has a navigation bar which has options such as subscription, payment method etc. The app is created using android studio, firebase, AWS S3.

# Desktop
The publisher can upload his apps/plugins and see the details such as the profile, dashboard, metrics. We can also see the user ratings in the form of bar graph. For every download button clicked the values of the metrics keep on differing.
